# Hybrid Geolocation Approach: Using StreetCLIP and Boundary-Based Regression. 
## COMP 5790/6790: Computer Vision.
### Shyam Patel - Term Project

## Introduction
This is the term project for COMP 5790/6790 - Computer Vision. This project was developed by Shyam Patel and it explores the current problems in the Geolocation space in the Computer Vision field. This repository contains all the files I developed as well as a ui.py file to display a demo that is functional. I have removed the dataset from this repository but you can find and download it here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohanmyer/geotagged-streetview-images or https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanmyer/geotagged-streetview-images-15k

## Features
- 📍 **Boundary-Constrained Predictions**
- 🚀 **Accurate Adjustments**
- 🔍 **Comprehensive Visualizations**
- 📺 **User Interface**

## Setup
I used WSL on VSCode and prefered to use a venv over conda, but both can work. The requirement.txt contains all the packages needed to run the code - I would use a venv.
To setup your environment run these commands:
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
